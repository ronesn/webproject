				The high air pollution caused by fossil fuels
				significantly alters the climate and living conditions
				in Asia.<br> <br> 
				The Asian brown cloud is a huge cloud
				of polution about 3000 meters thick, extending over
				an area equivalent to the U.S. <br><br>
				As this part of the world it is not raining hardly 4 months
				in the winter, the sky is not washed from its dust
				accumulate up sometimes obscure the sun.<br><br>
				This thick &lt&ltfog of pollution &gt&gt

				is considered the biggest pollution
				in the world.<br><br>
				The cloud covers a large part of<br>
				Asia for 5 months a year.<br><br>
				The mist itself is toxic and has<br>
				a negative impact on the<br>
				environment and on the health<br>
				of the population.<br><br><br><br>

				and raise awareness the population
				about serious topic of the polution.<br>
				The aim is to inform simply in a
				ludic way.<br><br>
				index 8 studies the differents levels
				of AQI (air quality index) in the 8
				most polluted cities in China.<br>
				The AQI is an index for reporting
				daily air quality.<br><br>
				It tells you how clean or polluted
				your air is.<br>
				The purpose of the AQI is to help
				you understand what local air

				quality means to your health.<br>
				AQI is divided into six categories.<br><br>
				We imagined a logo in constant
				motion, depending on the AQI the
				logo changes.<br><br>
				There is in this scheme the
				differents levels of AQI and at what
				the logo corresponds.<br><br>
				For all China cities the logo evolve
				during differents moments of the

				in depending of its AQI.<br><br>
				For all China cities the logo evolve
				during differents moments of the
				day.<br><br>
				Each cities have the same shape
				for start and it evolves differently in
				depending of its AQI.<br><br>
				We can compare every cities in
				differents times of the day and the
				monthly average of each them.<br><br>
				More the polution increases, more
				the shape becomes denser and
				lines multiplies.
