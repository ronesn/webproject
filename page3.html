					We imagined a logo in constant motion, depending<br>
					on the AQI the logo changes.<br>
					There is in this scheme the differents levels of AQI<br>
					and at what the logo corresponds.<br>
					For all China cities the logo evolve during differents<br>
					moments of the day.<br>
					Each cities have the same shape for start and<br>
					it evolves differently in depending of its AQI.<br>
					We can compare every cities in different times<br>
					of the day and the monthly average of each them.<br>
					More the polution increases, more the shape<br>
					becomes denser and lines multiplies.<br>
